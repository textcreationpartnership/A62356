            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MEeting, ſometime ſince, with this Book in <hi>Latin,</hi> I thought it well worth my Money, did it but anſwer its Title Page; and finding my ſelf, upon the Peruſal, not much diſappointed, I reſolved to turn it into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the benefit of ſuch as might not, perhaps, underſtand the <hi>Latin;</hi> and yet be no leſs curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than my ſelf to be Inform'd of the Matters contained therein: Since, by being Inſtructed in the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, the Matches, the Increments, and the Decrements of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in <hi>Europe;</hi> together with the many Pretences that ariſe from thence, which is chiefly the Subject of the enſuing Diſcourſe, they will, (in all
<pb facs="tcp:62903:4"/>probability) be the better enabled to judge of the different Intereſts which have engaged almoſt all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> in a War, the Event where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſo much concerns this Nation, and conſequently, is the general Topick of Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here pretend to give an Account of the many Advantages which may be drawn from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> and how neceſſary a Qualification 'tis for a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> ſince to ſay all One ought on that ſubject, would ſwell this <hi>Preface</hi> to a Bulk, diſproportionate to the Treatiſe it ſelf, which pretends to no more than a Compendium.</p>
            <p>Yet, ſince 'tis probable the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would gladly know ſomewhat of the Author thereof; the beſt account that can be given of him is from Himſelf and Book. In order to which, he lets you know, in his <hi>Epiſtle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory,</hi> That he is a Profeſſor in the
<pb facs="tcp:62903:4"/>Univerſity at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and that the Book was the firſt Fruits of his Office; It having been read as Lectures, or a Compendious Introduction to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy and Hiſtory of the preſent Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> for the benefit of the Students there, and ſince Printed, to be rendred more publickly uſeful. The Method he has taken herein is Eaſie and Plain; the Genealogical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations are exact; and the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as full of Matter as the nature of his deſign would bear: Not but that having laboured in a Soyl, capable of mighty Improvements, as to the laſt, if this firſt Impreſſion find that kind Reception as may be expected, it may incourage the <hi>Tranſlator,</hi> or ſome <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to reſume the Work; and by engrafting on his Stock, bring the Growth to a greater Perfection; an Eſſay whereof you already have in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:62903:5"/>
            <p>In the mean time, the Book, as it now ſtands, is of good Uſe, and may merit a favourable Reception, as well from the moſt Learned, as from the Ignorant: For altho' the former may be ſuppoſed to be already acquainted with what is contained herein, yet it will always ſerve them as a <hi>Summary</hi> or <hi>Common Place.</hi> And tho' the latter will not be rendered thorough-paced Hiſtorians hereby, yet will it give them a general Inſight into the modern Story of <hi>Europe,</hi> together with a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of being farther Informed.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more, I thought fit to acquaint the <hi>Reader</hi> withal, which is, That in the <hi>Latin</hi> Copy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt King <hi>James</hi> the Second's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, there is one mentioned and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Prince of Wales;</hi> but the late Licenſer, Mr. <hi>Bohun,</hi> having expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Him, the Tranſlator could not, by the Warrant of the <hi>Latin</hi> Original, preſume to inſert Him.</p>

               <p>§. I. BEing to give a Genealogical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all the Soveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces now flouriſhing in <hi>Europe,</hi> 'twill be but juſt to begin with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> as being of the Firſt Dignity: Which as it owes its Original without doubt, to the Earls of <hi>Habſburg;</hi> ſo in tracing the Pedigree of thoſe Earls, moſt Genealogiſts are at a loſs. As for us, we ſhall not doubt to derive 'em from the Counts of <hi>Mont-Aventine,</hi> of the <hi>Anician Perleonian</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which was formerly of the greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and Authority of any in <hi>Rome;</hi> and had its Seat on <hi>Mont-Aventine,</hi> being chiefly induc'd thereunto by the Arguments us'd by <hi>Pet. Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bechius,</hi> in his <hi>Comment. de Biblioth. Caeſar. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. In the Twelfth Century there flouriſh'd in this Family, one <hi>Leo Anicius Perleonius,</hi> Count
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62903:9"/>of <hi>Mont-Aventine,</hi> whoſe Epitaph may be read in Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi>'s Eccleſiaſtical Annals, <hi>ad Annum</hi> MC XL. He was deſcended in a direct Line from the Emperour <hi>Flavius Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Olybrius;</hi> and in the Title to his Epitaph, is ſtyled, <hi>The most Noble of the</hi> Romans. His Son was <hi>Peter Leo Anicius Perleonius,</hi> Count of <hi>Mont-Aventine;</hi> whoſe Epitaph may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe found in the ſame Eccleſiaſtical Annals, <hi>Tom.</hi> 12. <hi>ad Annum</hi> MC XLIV. This <hi>Peter</hi> begat <hi>leo Maximus Anicius Perleonius,</hi> who died in 1162. witneſs his Epitaph, which may be ſeen to this day before St. <hi>Alexius</hi> his Church on <hi>Mont-Aventine</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and is recited by <hi>Arnoldus Wion,</hi> in the Firſt Part of his <hi>Lignum Vitae, ſive Hiſtor. Ord. Benedict.</hi> as likewiſe by <hi>Johan. Seifrid</hi> Abbot of <hi>Wethalen,</hi> in his <hi>Arbor Aniciana, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. His Son was <hi>Albertus Dives Anicius Perleonius,</hi> who was driven out of <hi>Rome</hi> in 1144. by the <hi>Arnaldaſtick</hi> Hereticks, together with his Brother <hi>Rudolph,</hi> in defence of the <hi>Roman</hi> See; whereupon he travell'd into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and there married the Daughter of <hi>Wernerus,</hi> laſt Earl of <hi>Habsburg,</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Altenburg;</hi> and by that means became the firſt Earl of <hi>Habsburg,</hi> of the <hi>Anician Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leonian</hi> Race: See Abbot <hi>Seifrid.

After this Mock-Election, <hi>Richard</hi> III. now no longer Protector, was Crown'd King, <hi>July</hi> 6. following, with the ſelf-ſame Proviſion that was appointed for the Coronation of his Nephew; with this addition only, That his Queen was Crown'd with him. And now the firſt thing he did was to commit <hi>Morton</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> (who had been ſecur'd in the <hi>Tower</hi>) to the Cuſtody of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who ſent him to a Houſe of his at <hi>Brecknock</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> whence he afterwards eſcap'd, to the deſtruction of King <hi>Richard.</hi> That done, the King made a progreſs to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and ſent one <hi>John Green</hi> (whom he 'ſpecially truſted) with a Letter of Credence to Sir <hi>Robert Brakenbury,</hi> Conſtable of the <hi>Tower;</hi> the effect of which was, to put the young Princes to death; which he abſolutely refus'd, though (ſaid he) he were to die therefore. On this, he ſent another Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Sir <hi>James Tyrrel,</hi> with a Command to <hi>Brakenbury,</hi> to deliver him the Keys of the <hi>Tower</hi> for one Night; which was accordingly done, and the Princes murder'd by one <hi>Miles Forreſt,</hi> a Fellow fleſh'd in Blood before that time, and <hi>John Dighton,</hi> his own Groom. The
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62903:62"/>Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had accompanied the King in his Progreſs; but whether it were that the King had been remiſs to him in his Promiſe touching the Earldom of <hi>Hereford,</hi> or that the Duke look'd a-skew on the Crown he had procur'd him, the Duke left him at <hi>Glouceſter;</hi> but not without large Aſſurances from the King, who doubted nothing leſs but that he was pleaſed: And ſo with a merry Countenance, and a diſguſted Heart, the Duke went off to his Charge at <hi>Brecknock.</hi> The Biſhop had been a firm Adherer to the Houſe of <hi>Loncaſter;</hi> and the Duke had loſt his Father and Grandfather in their Quarrel. This, and the but juſt Reputation of the Biſhop's Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, begat a Familiarity between them; which after ſeveral broken Diſcourſes off and on, came at laſt to this, That they took an Oath of Secreſie to each other; and the PRESENT USURPATION and Tyranny was the Single Argument. The Duke ran over the King's Breach of Faith with him, and particularly charges him with the Murder of his Nephews, which he had ſworn to him never to attempt. Nor was the Biſhop wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to give the Flame vent; and as Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offer'd, to add freſh Fuel to the Fire. On which, it was at laſt reſolv'd between them, That the <hi>Tyrant</hi> be remov'd: And for the manner of doing it, the Biſhop (having got within him) propoſes to him his own Title, as Grandchild by the Mother, to <hi>Edmond</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> lineally deſcended from <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt;</hi> and ſo next Heir to King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. Which the Duke anſwer'd, by ſaying, He
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62903:63"/>once thought ſo, and had reſolv'd on it; 'till having better conſider'd, he remembred, That <hi>Edmond</hi> his Grandfather had an elder Brother, <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> whoſe Daughter the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Richmond,</hi> is ſole Heir to him; and therefore, to marry her Son <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eldſt Daughter of King <hi>Edward</hi> IV. and there by unite the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> were the only Expedient to ſettle the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Biſhop now was where he would be; and therefore for fear the matter ſhould cool, propoſes a ſober Gentleman, one <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald Gray,</hi> (a Servant of the Counteſs's, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Duke) who ſhould communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Affair to ſuch Perſons as the Duke ſhould direct. Which being approv'd of, <hi>Gray</hi> is forthwith ſent for, and diſpatch'd to the Counteſs; who liked it ſo well, that ſhe ſent one <hi>Lewis</hi> her Phyſician to acquaint the Queen with it; who return'd him to the Counteſs with this Anſwer, That if her Son <hi>Henry</hi> would take a corporal Oath to marry her Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that all the Friends and Favourers of King <hi>Edward</hi> her Husband, ſhould aſſiſt and take part with him. Which being agreed to by the Counteſs, ſhe ſent <hi>Chriſtopher Urſwick</hi> her Chaplain to her Son, in <hi>Bretagne;</hi> and by another way, Monies, and particular Inſtructions that he ſhould land in <hi>Wales.</hi> Matters thus diſpoſed, and Anſwers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, the Duke and the Biſhop engage ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Nobility and Gentry in an Oath of Secreſie, and every of them prepare Forces to meet the Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and joyn him: Yet
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62903:63"/>things were not ſo cloſely carried, but that King <hi>Richard</hi> got an inkling of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ply'd the Duke of <hi>Bretagne</hi> (to whom the Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> had open'd his Deſign) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the ſaid Earl into his hands: Which he not only refus'd, but, on the contrary, aſſiſted him with Men and Monies. During which, the Biſhop took the opportunity of making an eſcape into <hi>Flanders;</hi> which fretted the Duke; and that the more, in regard the King (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Duke to be in the head of the Buſineſs) wrote him a kind Letter, thereby inviting him to Court; which he excus'd with pretence of Sickneſs. Whereupon the King ſent him a peremptory Command; which he as deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately anſwered by word of mouth, That he would not come to his mortal Enemy; and ſent immediately to his Friends to take Arms with him; which they accordingly did: But before they could join him, the Duke's Forces were diſpers'd, and every Man ſhifted for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as he beſt might: Moſt of the Chief of which got into <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and the Duke to the Houſe of one <hi>Baniſter</hi> (beſide <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>) whom he had bred from his Youth, and lov'd and truſted above all Men; yet for the hopes of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> which was ſet upon the Duke's Head, he was betray'd by him, and brought to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> where he was beheaded without Trial, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1. the ſame Year. And the Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and ſuch as had gotten over to him, were attainted in Parliament, 1484. Nor was the Earl idle all this time, but applied himſelf to <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. King of <hi>France,</hi> who liberally aſſiſted him ſuitable to the Expedition.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62903:64"/>And ſo the Earl having given the <hi>Engliſh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility his Oath, That forthwith after his being poſſeſs'd of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> he would take to Wife the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as aforeſaid, they ſwore him Fealty, and did him Homage, and made ready to ſet forward for <hi>England:</hi> And being inform'd, That <hi>Richard</hi> had gotten the Daughters of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. into his hand, with the Conſent of the Queen their Mother, and made away his Wife, to the intent of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the ſaid Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he made the more haſte; and with the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and the reſt, put to Sea, and landed at <hi>Milford</hi> Haven the <hi>Auguſt</hi> following; and thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd to <hi>Hereford,</hi> where the Country came in to him; and a Meſſage from the Town of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> That they were ready to give their attendance on the Earl their Lord. By which means, and ſeveral of King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Party falling in with him, his Army grew ſtronger daily; and the Lord <hi>Stanly</hi> (who had married the Counteſs of <hi>Richmond,</hi> Mother to <hi>Henry</hi>) lay hovering with an Army of five thouſand Men; but durſt not declare for him, for fear of the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> his Son, whom King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> kept as an Hoſtage for his Father's not acting againſt him. Yet was not <hi>Richard</hi> ſo amaz'd at it, but that he met his Enemy with a powerful Army at <hi>Boſworth</hi> near <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> where, in the heat of the Battel, the Lord <hi>Stanly</hi> joyn'd Earl <hi>Henry</hi> with his freſh Forces, as alſo did Sir <hi>William Stanly</hi> his Brother with three thouſand more, and ſlew King <hi>Richard, Aug.</hi> 22. 1485. whoſe Crown (found among the Spoil) he forthwith put on the Head of

His Father's Funerals, and his own Marriage with the Princeſs <hi>Catharine,</hi> Widow of his Brother <hi>Arthur</hi> (by the Diſpenſation of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> II.) being over, his next buſineſs was their Coronation, which was perform'd <hi>June</hi> 24. 1509. and quieting the Clamours of the People, touching the matter of Sir <hi>Richard Empſom,</hi> and <hi>Edmond Dudley</hi> Eſq; Perſons em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by <hi>Henry</hi> VII. for compounding the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures upon Penal Statutes; which they had manag'd ſo ill, that being thereof ſeverally convicted, they were attainted in Parliament of High Treaſon, and thereupon beheaded, <hi>Aug.</hi> 18. 1510. Howbeit, <hi>John Dudley,</hi> Son and Heir of the ſaid <hi>Edmond,</hi> was reſtor'd in Blood by the ſame Parliament; and towards the latter end of the King, made Viſcount <hi>Liſle,</hi> and Lord High Admiral of <hi>England.</hi> The New-years day following, the Queen was brought to bed of a Prince, named <hi>Henry,</hi> who died <hi>Feb.</hi> 22. following. And now the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the Court being ſomewhat allay'd, the King reſolv'd of a Royal Expedition into <hi>France,</hi> to which the Parliament gave largely; but not thinking it ſafe to leave the before-mention'd <hi>Edmond de la Pool</hi> behind him, he took off his Head, <hi>April</hi> 30. 1512. and having created Sir <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> (Son of Sir <hi>William Brandon,</hi> Standard-Bearer to <hi>Henry</hi> VII. at <hi>Boſworth</hi>-Field, and there ſlain) Viſcount <hi>Liſte,</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:62903:69"/>he landed at <hi>Callice, June</hi> 30. 1513. and taking the Field, laid ſiege to <hi>Terwin;</hi> where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Maximilian</hi> taking pay under him, wore the Croſs of St. <hi>George,</hi> as the King's Soldier.

From thence he advanced to the City of <hi>Tournay,</hi> took it, and return'd for <hi>England, Septemb.</hi> 24. To divert the King from this purſuit in <hi>France, James</hi> IV. of <hi>Scotland</hi> had invaded <hi>England,</hi> and beſieged <hi>Norham</hi> Caſtle, but was encounter'd by the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> (Lieutenant of the North in the King's abſence) at <hi>Flodden</hi> Field, where the ſaid King loſt his Army and Life together, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 9. the ſame Year.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62903:69"/>took effect; with this Condition, That if the <hi>French</hi> King died, then the Lady (if it ſtood with her Pleaſure) might return into <hi>England</hi> again, with all her Dowry and Riches. Which being conſented to, a Peace was proclaim'd <hi>Aug.</hi> 7. the Marriage conſummated <hi>Octob.</hi> 9. the Queen Crown'd <hi>Novemb.</hi> 5 1515. and came to <hi>Paris</hi> the next day; where, after ſeveral ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Juſts, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> left her; and the King her Husband died <hi>Jan.</hi> 1. following.

Upon the death of King <hi>Lewis, Francis</hi> I. ſucceeded him, to whom, and the Queen his Siſter, King <hi>Henry</hi> having made the uſual Compliments; and being advertis'd of her Inclination to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> he ſent the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her; which was honourably condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, and the Queen deliver'd to him; who pleas'd her ſo well, that ſhe married him at <hi>Callice,</hi> and return'd with him for <hi>England,</hi> 1516. The King ſeems offended at it, but is quickly reconcil'd: However, the Cardinal (now Legate <hi>à Latere</hi>) diſobliges him, and not him only, but the Prime Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> particularly <hi>Edward Stafford</hi> Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (the laſt hereditary High Conſtable of <hi>England</hi>) whoſe Head alſo he brought to the Block, <hi>May</hi> 17. 1521. and with that, and his other Exorbitances, the general Hatred of the Commons upon himſelf. But what haſten'd
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62903:70"/>his Ruine may ſeem to be this: <hi>Charles</hi> V. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had refuſed him the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo;</hi> to be reveng'd of this, he procured a Friendſhip between King <hi>Henry</hi> and the King of <hi>France,</hi> to the end, That if (probably) a Divorce could be made between the King and Queen (Aunt to the ſaid Emperour) that the King might have married the Dutcheſs of <hi>Alençon,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Siſter. However it were, the King (after a Twenty Years Marriage) makes it a Scruple of Conſcience, Whether ſhe could be his lawful Wife, as having been the Widow of his elder Brother Prince <hi>Arthur;</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours a Divorce; from which, the Queen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to the Pope.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62903:70"/>a large Inventory; and ſending it to the King, by Sir <hi>William Gaſcoigne</hi> his Treaſurer, retired into the Country: Howbeit, the Biſhopricks of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter</hi> were not taken from him, nor Plate and Houſhold-ſtuff ſufficient for his Degree. His Power thus clipp'd, one would have thought it ſufficient; but (alas!) he had a Head yet left, and who knew but the King might not have quite forgotten him; therefore to make ſure Work, and him a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Example, (for thoſe are the Words) there were Forty three Articles, ſigned by the ſaid Chancellor, and by Fourteen Lords of the Privy-Council, and the Two Chief Juſtices, exhibited to the King, againſt him, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1. 1530. which being brought down from the Lords to the Commons, <hi>Thomas Cromwel</hi> his Secretary (a Member of the Houſe) made ſo honeſt a Defence of his Maſter, that the King took him into his Service. After which, the Lord Chancellor <hi>Mocre</hi> (as little fond of having the King marry the Lady <hi>Bullen,</hi> as had been the Cardinal) foreſeeing the Cloud that was gathering againſt him, after long ſuit made to be diſcharged of his Office, gave up the Seal, <hi>May</hi> 7. 1532. and was beheaded for denying the King's Supremacy, <hi>July</hi> 6. 1535. or rather, becauſe that he had not put on his Wedding-Garment for the Lady <hi>Bullen,</hi> whom he made Marchioneſs of <hi>Pembroke, Septemb.</hi> 1. married her <hi>Jan.</hi> 25. following, in the preſence of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> his late Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> whom (not long after) he made Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> Whereupon it was enacted, That Queen <hi>Catharine</hi> ſhould no more be called Queen, but
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62903:71"/>Princeſs Dowager: And the Archbiſhop (not to be wanting on his part) divorc'd her from the King, and by a Publick Sentence, declar'd the Marriage to be void and of none effect, <hi>May</hi> 23. 1533. On which, Queen <hi>Anne</hi> was Crown'd, <hi>June</hi> 1. delivered of a Daughter (<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who afterwards was Queen) <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temb.</hi> 10. following. And laſtly (after a like Divorce) beheaded with a Sword, <hi>May</hi> 19. 1536.

Nor was the King wanting to give him a Figure ſuitable to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; for in the compaſs of three Years, he made him Maſter of the Jewel-Houſe, a Privy Councellor, Secretary, Maſter of the Rolls, Lord Privy-Seal, and Baron <hi>Cromwell, July</hi> 10. 1536. Vicegerent <hi>(in Spiritualibus)</hi> the 18th. of the ſame Month: Knight of the Garter, <hi>April</hi> 23. 1538.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62903:73"/>it came into the Protector's and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil's mind, of a Match that (upon the death of King <hi>James</hi> V.

During this, and his Brother the Lord Admiral's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whether it were that the Protector's Wife could not brook the Queen Dowager <hi>Parr,</hi> her Husband's (the Admiral's) younger Brother's Wife, to take place of her; or that the Admiral kept not thorough-pace with him, there grew ſuch a feud between the Brothers, that coſt them both their Heads: For within a Year and half after their return, the Admiral was ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Nor had he recover'd this falſe Step, before he made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſlipping an Opportunity that play'd into his hand; for the Commiſſioners having thrown all Images, and what thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain'd, out of the Churches, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aboliſh'd the Miſſal, and enjoyn'd a New Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments</hi> in its room, the <hi>Corniſh</hi> Men firſt, and after them, <hi>Oxfordſhire, Bucking, hamſhire, Norfolk, York,</hi> and others, ran into Rebellion, which he fortunately ſuppreſs'd, and thereby became Maſter of an Army, which he might have wrought to any thing, at leaſt cruſh'd his diſguis'd Friend, but ſecret Enemy, the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who had ſtola the Lords of the Council from him, and now jointly impeach'd him, as the occaſion of the late Tumults; and at the ſame time pray the City and the Commons, to aid them to take him from the King: Whereupon he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Tower, Octob.</hi> 14 following; and having not Intereſt enough to hinder the ſaid Earl from being made Lord High-Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, he tamely ſubmitted to a Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Earl's eldeſt Son, and his eldeſt Daughter, and got his Liberty for that time. But this patch'd Friendſhip laſted not above two Years; for the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> being made Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Henry Gray</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet</hi> (his Conſident) Duke of <hi>Suffolk, Octob.</hi> 11. 1551. and now Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning all, the late Protector was (within five days after) again committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62903:74"/>convicted of Felony, upon a Statute of his own making; <hi>viz.</hi> For purpoſing and attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting the Lives of (the ſaid <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi>) two of the King's Privy-Council, which by that Statute was made Felony. On which, he was beheaded <hi>Jan.</hi> 22. following: And the King left ſo unguarded by any but themſelves and their Creatures, that it ſeem'd no difficulty to bring the Crown into their own Families. To this purpoſe, a Marriage is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd between the Lord <hi>Guilford Dudley,</hi> Fourth Son of the ſaid Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Jane Gray,</hi> eldeſt Daughter of the ſaid Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> by <hi>Frances,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Mary,</hi> Siſter of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. of whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and that ſo cover'd under the ſpecious Pretence of ſecuring the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> the King's Siſter, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, that the King not only further'd it, but being in a ſickly condition, did by his laſt Will and Teſtament, declare the ſaid Lady <hi>Jane Gray,</hi> to be Rightful Heir in Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> To which alſo (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Lords of the Council) all the Judges ſubſcrib'd their Names, excepting only Sir. <hi>James Hales</hi> (one of the Juſtices of the Common-Pleas) who would neither by Word nor Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting give his Aſſent to the diſheriſon of Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> Not long after which, the King died, to wit, <hi>July</hi> 6. 1553. in the Seventeenth Year of his Age, and Seventh of his Reign; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, and Childleſs, and might (perhaps) have liv'd longer, if he had not been a King.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62903:75"/>
               <p>Three days after, the Lady <hi>Jane Gray</hi> was proclaimed Queen; and the ſame day the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> Siſter of the laſt King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and eldeſt Daughter of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> VIII. ſent a Letter to the Lords of the Council, thereby claiming the Crown by Right of Succeſſion; and requiring them upon their Allegiance, to have her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd Queen.

               <p>XXII. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> (a Catholick) being thus proclaim'd, the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was arreſted at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and brought to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and (together with the Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> Son and Heir of the ſaid Duke) arraign'd of High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Lord High-Steward of <hi>England;</hi> where praying the Opinion of the Court, Whether a Man doing an Act by Authority of the Prince's Council, and by Warrant of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing without the ſame, may be charg'd
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62903:75"/>with Treaſon for any thing done by virtue of the ſame? And being anſwer'd, That the Great Seal which he laid for his Warrant, was not the Seal of the Lawful Queen of the Realm, but the Seal of an Uſurper, and therefore no Warrant to him; he confeſs'd the Indictment (as alſo did the other two) and had Judgment, as in Caſes of High-Treaſon, <hi>Aug.</hi> 18. the ſame Year: On which, the ſaid Duke was beheaded the 22d. and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> Crown'd <hi>Octob.</hi> 1. following: At which time alſo, ſhe publiſh'd a General Pardon; in which notwithſtanding, were excepted by Name, the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and others of the Clergy; and the two Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, Sir <hi>Edward Montacute,</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger Cholmley,</hi> with other Men of the Law, for counſelling, or at leaſt conſenting to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and aiding the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in the pretended Right of the before-mention'd Lady <hi>Jane;</hi> who (with her Husband) were arraign'd and attainted <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. next enſuing, as alſo was Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer.</hi> The beginning of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> following, the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. ſent over Ambaſſadours, fully impower'd to treat and conclude a Marriage between Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Son and Heir; which afterwards took effect. But this Match being not ſo well reliſh'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, nor much better by ſome of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it was confederated between them to raiſe a War, rather than ſuffer ſuch a Change of State, as they doubted might follow, by the Queen's thus Matching her ſelf with a Stranger.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62903:76"/>The firſt that appear'd in it was Sir <hi>Tho. Wiat</hi> (a powerful Man in <hi>Kent.</hi>) The occaſion thus: A near Friend of his, one of the Conſpirators, was committed to the <hi>Fleet</hi> (by the Council) for other matters; whereupon Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting that the Plot was diſcover'd, ran into Arms before the time that had been appointed between them: However, having gotten a ſtrong Party together, he publiſh'd a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (at <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi>) againſt the ſaid Marriage; and thereby deſired his Friends, and all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, to join with him and others, to defend the Realm from the danger of being brought in Thraldom to Strangers: Whereupon ſeveral conſiderable Perſons, with their Followers, came in to him. And the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> made the like Proclamation in <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> Nor wanted the Queen, on the other hand, ſuch as gather'd as faſt to ſuppreſs them; for the Lord <hi>Abergavenny</hi> having op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd him in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> ſhut their Gates againſt the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> there ſeem'd nothing to the contrary, but the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> by this time gone down againſt him, muſt have ſwallow'd him; as probably he had done, but that 500 of the <hi>London</hi> White-Coats that went with him, revolted, and took part with <hi>Wiat.</hi> Upon which, the Duke made what retreat he could, and <hi>Wiat</hi> went on for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> but being beaten off at <hi>London</hi>-Bridge, he got over at <hi>Kingſton,</hi> and was ſo encounter'd from <hi>Park</hi> Corner to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and thence to <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> and through the <hi>Strand,</hi> that being not able to make further than <hi>Temple-Earr,</hi> where he met a freſh Oppoſition, he

To which the Queen anſwer'd, That though ſhe would no way derogate from her Right, yet ſhe ſhould be loth to endanger her own Security, and, as it were, cover her Eyes with a Grave-Cloth while ſhe was alive. And here began the Jealouſies of State between the two Queens; the one doubting her Succeſſion was intended to be fruſtrated; and the other, That her Poſſeſſion might be invaded. And yet they kept it ſo fair with each other, that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> being, in 1563. follicited by her Uncle the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to a Marriage with <hi>Charles</hi> Archduke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> (with an Offer of the Arrears of her Dowry, and a Reſtauration of the <hi>Scots</hi> to their former Liberties in <hi>France,</hi> which by the death of her Uncle, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> had been broken, in caſe ſhe would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the <hi>French</hi> (againſt whom the Queen of <hi>England</hi> had about that time aſſiſted the <hi>Hugonots</hi>) ſhe gives her notice of it, and requires

Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> on the other hand, perſuades her to take a Husband out of <hi>England,</hi> and recommends to her the Lord <hi>Robert Dudley</hi> (whom not long after ſhe made Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>) withal promiſing, That if ſhe would marry him, ſhe ſhould by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament be declar'd her Succeſſor, in caſe ſhe died without Iſſue: But whether it were that ſhe diſdain'd the one, or that ſhe was loth to make a breach with <hi>England,</hi> by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the other, nothing came of either. But having (by the leave of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) gotten <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darnly,</hi> Son of <hi>Matthew Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> by <hi>Margaret Douglas,</hi> Niece of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. by his eldeſt Siſter, out of <hi>England</hi> (upon pretence of reſtoring him to the Poſſeſſions of his Father, who had been in <hi>England</hi> as an Exile now twenty years, made him Lord <hi>Armanack,</hi> Earl of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Rothſey,</hi> a Dukedom by Birth appertaining to the eldeſt Sons of the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him in five Months after, and with the Conſent of moſt of the Peers of <hi>Scotland,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd him King, about <hi>June</hi> 1565.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62903:80"/>Whereupon Multitudes flock in to her; but being undiſciplin'd, they are defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Murray;</hi> Herſelf nevertheleſs making an eſcape into <hi>England,</hi> landed at <hi>Wicking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in <hi>Cumberland, May</hi> 17. 1568. having firſt ſent her Servant <hi>Beaton</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to intimate her Intention; with a Diamond Ring alſo, which ſhe had formerly receiv'd from her, as a Pledge of mutual Amity. Nor was ſhe ſooner landed than ſhe wrote her a Letter, thereby declaring her Condition; and withal deſiring ſhe might be conducted to her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. To which, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent by Sir <hi>Francis Knolles,</hi> return'd her a comfortable Anſwer, and promiſed her Aid and Defence, according to the Equity of her Cauſe; but deny'd her acceſs, for that ſhe was held guilty of many Crimes; and therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd her to be brought to <hi>Carliſle.</hi> From thence ſhe ſeconded her firſt Letter, further praying, That ſhe might have leave to unfold the Injuries ſhe had receiv'd, and anſwer the Crimes objected in her preſence; withal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, It was but reaſonable that the Queen ſhould hear her, and reſtore her to her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, againſt thoſe, whom when they liv'd in exile for their Offences againſt her, ſhe had fully reſtor'd at the Queen's Interceſſion, but to her own undoing, if not prevented in time.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62903:80"/>Meſſages, and Tokens. Upon this, the Queen commiſerating her Condition, could have found in her Heart to have reſtor'd her, had the Council thought it ſtood with the Queen's ſecurity: And therefore the Queſtion was, What ſhould be done with her? To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her in <hi>England,</hi> it was to be fear'd thoſe that favour'd her Title to the Crown, would leave nothing unattempted to ſet it on her Head: And moreover, the Truſt of Keepers was very uncertain: To ſend her for <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Guiſes</hi> (her Kindred) were too powerful; and to return her into <hi>Scotland,</hi> thoſe that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would be put from their Places; the <hi>French</hi> advanc'd; the young King expos'd to danger; the Religion chang'd; <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> invaded by the <hi>Highlanders;</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in hazard at home: And therefore it was thought beſt to detain her, 'till ſhe had given ſatisfaction for uſurping the Title and Arms of <hi>England,</hi> and anſer'd for the Death of the Lord <hi>Darnly,</hi> a Native Subject of the Queen's. Yet it had this effect, That the Queen ſent to <hi>Murray</hi> and his Confederates, to come and anſwer the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and give ſufficient Reaſons why they had depriv'd her, or that ſhe would reſtore her. On which, <hi>Murray</hi> with ſeven others came to <hi>York</hi> (the Place appointed) and were the ſame Day met by the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and two others, Commiſſioners for Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth:</hi> But the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> diſdaining to be heard by her Subjects, or any thing leſs than the Queen her ſelf, nothing came of it but Words: And <hi>Murray</hi> return'd to his Regency;

In whoſe room was elected, by the Lords of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the before-mention'd <hi>Matthew</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> the young King's Grandfather. And now frequent applications having been made to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> for the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> but without effect, ſhe was Excommunicated by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. <hi>Feb.</hi> 24. the ſame Year; which occaſion'd her many Troubles, and at laſt the death of the Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi> who after an Eighteen Years impriſonment, was arraign'd, tried, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd (by 'ſpecial Commiſſion) at <hi>Fothering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>-Caſtle; for that pretending a Title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſhe was privy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to ſeveral Treaſons, tending to the Invaſion of <hi>England,</hi> and the Hurt, Death, and Deſtruction of the Queen, <hi>Octob.</hi> 25. 1586.

After which, the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> by her Ambaſſidour (Sir <hi>Robert Sidney</hi>) let the Queen know, That he had over-paſs'd all Injuries, and deſired a ſincere and perfect Amity with her: And as an inſtance of it, not only mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Anne,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Frederick</hi> II.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62903:82"/>upon the Queen's Requeſt, deliver'd back into <hi>Ireland,</hi> 1590.

                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:62903:82"/>Nor had the King been ſcarce warm in his Throne, when the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and others, were arraign'd and convicted of High-Treaſon, for a Conſpiracy to kill the King, raiſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, alter Religion, ſubvert the State, and procure an Invaſion; of which Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> (a mortal Enemy to <hi>Spain,</hi> and no Friend of the <hi>Scots</hi>) was one; and after a Fourteen Years reprieval (by the means of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lieger <hi>Gundomar</hi>) had his Head taken off up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the former Judgment, though there wanted not thoſe that thought it was <hi>Jure &amp; Injuria.</hi> And now came on the Buſineſs of <hi>Spain:</hi> As King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King was in Amity with <hi>Spain;</hi> as King of <hi>England,</hi> at War with it: And therefore finding himſelf under that double Circumſtance, he firſt call'd in all Letters of Mart againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, concluded a Peace with them; to the Confirmation of which, <hi>Albertus</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Archdukes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> were ſworn. And thus in Peace with all Chriſtendom, the King crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Second Son <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> (then Four Years old) Duke of <hi>York, Jan.</hi> 2. 1604. with the yearly Fee of 40 <hi>l.</hi> payable by the Sheriff of <hi>York</hi> out of the Iſſues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of that County.</p>
               <p>The Year following was diſcover'd the <hi>Gun-Powder Treaſon Plot,</hi> which ended in the Attainder and Death of the Conſpirators; and was particularly congratulated by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Archdukes of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> In the Year 1610. the King (having had an Aid of his Subjects to make his Son a Knight) created Prince <hi>Henry</hi> (now Seventeen Years of Age)
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62903:83"/>Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi> but he liv'd not long to enjoy it; for during the Treaty of a Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Frederick</hi> Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> with the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the King's only Daughter, he ſell ſick, and died, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 6. 1612. However, the Marriage took effect, and was conſummated on St. <hi>Valentine</hi>'s Day following: And Prince <hi>Charles</hi> created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> 1615. But hear the time the King had created his Son <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> he created a new Patent-Honour of deſcendible Knighthood, by the Name of <hi>Knights Baronets.</hi> The occaſion thus:</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the King's Reign, <hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Montjoy,</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> return'd for <hi>England,</hi> and brought over with him <hi>Hugh O Neal,</hi> Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> who (Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> yet living) had ſubmitted himſelf to the Queen's Mercy, and whom the King par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd; and made proclamation, That he ſhould be treated with Reſpect and Honour. And yet in 1609. he goes off into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and with <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and others, gets beyond-Sea, and ſollicites a new Aſſiſtance from foreign Princes; but having left ſeveral forfeited Lands behind them, in the Counties of <hi>Colerain, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> and <hi>Donegal,</hi> the King comes to Articles with the City of <hi>London</hi> for the planting and building the ſame: Which being accepted, the King by his Charter, 1611. erects the Ville of <hi>Derry</hi> into a City, and the Town of <hi>Colerain</hi> into a Mayor-Town; and, together with the ſaid forfeited Lands, conſolidates the whole into one County; by the Name of the County of <hi>London-Derry:</hi> And having by the ſame
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62903:83"/>Charter created a Body Politick of Twenty four Perſons (Twelve of them to be annually elected out of the Twelve Firſt Companies of <hi>London</hi>) for the Government of the ſame, by the Name of <hi>The Society of the Governour and Aſſiſtants,</hi> London, <hi>of the New Plantation of</hi> Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>in the Realm of</hi> Ireland, grants the ſaid Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Town, County, and forfeited Lands, to the ſaid Society, and their Succeſſors in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, under the yearly Rent of 205 <hi>l.</hi> And now to give Countenance to it, and put 200000 <hi>l.</hi> in his Pocket, without being behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to his Subjects, he erected this new Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and for him, his Heirs and Succeſſors, covenanted with each of them reſpectively, That they, and the Heirs Males of their Body, ſhould take Place next the youngeſt Sons of Barons: That (by way of augmentation to their own Arms) they ſhould bear a part of <hi>O Neal</hi>'s Arms; <hi>viz.</hi> in a Canton, or Eſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon Argent, a hand Dextre couped, Gules: And laſtly, ſtinted their Number to Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Perſons; whoſe Iſſue, as they chanc'd to fail, ſhould not be ſupplied with new Perſons, but the Order to run out. In which laſt Clauſe yet, the King covenanted for himſelf only, and left out his Heirs and Succeſſors; tho' (if the printed Liſts be true) Himſelf made Two hundred and One. In conſideration of which, each of them was to maintain Thirty Foot-Soldiers in <hi>Ireland</hi> for Three Years, after the rate of Eight-pence a Day; and for the payment of the Monies, ſtrike a Tally in the Exchequer for 1000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:62903:84"/>
               <p>The King alſo, ſome time after, erected a like Order of Baronets of <hi>Nova Scotia;</hi> who inſtead of the ſaid Hand dextre couped, ſhould wear an Orange-colour'd Ribbon athwart their Shoulders (as Knights of the Bath their Red Ribbon) with a Medal, on which the Arms of <hi>Scotland</hi> were enamell'd, and a Pear-Pearl at the end of it; with this Motto: <hi>Fax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is honeſtae Gloria.</hi> But whether (beſides the advantage of another Plantation) he got as much by the one, as he did by the other, does not appear: Though this may be ſaid of both, All Parties were well ſatisfied. Nor happen'd there, during this time, any thing much remarkable, ſaving the breaking one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites Neck, to make way for another; the placing and diſplacing of Great Officers; the frequent Creations of Nobility; which though it added to their Number, may (perhaps) be thought to have taken from their Grandeur, and the Death of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> which happen'd <hi>March</hi> 2. 1619.</p>
               <p>The Palſgrave <hi>Frederick</hi> thus ſtrengthen'd with the Alliance of <hi>England,</hi> was, in the Year 1621. elected King of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> Nor was he ſooner inveſted in the Crown, than the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Bann iſſued againſt him; which was ſo ſeconded with a longer Sword, that having loſt the Battel of <hi>Prague,</hi> and with it his New Crown, and his own Patrimony of the Upper and Lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> he was forc' to retire into <hi>Holland.</hi> On this, King <hi>James</hi> (though he never could be brought to own his Son-in-Law as a King) had that care of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he ſent an Embaſſie to the Emperour,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62903:84"/>to ſollicite the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> which returning without ſucceſs, he conſults <hi>Gundomar</hi> what to do in the matter; who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes him to make a Marriage with the Prince his Son, and the Infanta of <hi>Spain, Which</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>would be eaſily effected, if the Prince might have leave to make a Journey into</hi> Spain. Which was accordingly done, and the Prince receiv'd with all the Kindneſs and Magnificence ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable: Where having been ſpun out for eight Months together to no purpoſe (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Expectation of moſt Men) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd ſafe into <hi>England.</hi> Whereupon the King taking new meaſures, it was firſt reſolv'd to recover the <hi>Palatinate</hi> by Arms, in which the Parliament promiſed him a liberal Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and next, to provide the Prince a Wife elſewhere: For which purpoſe, an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie was ſent into <hi>France,</hi> to treat of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> younger Daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and Siſter of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. King of <hi>France;</hi> which took effect, but was not conſummated 'till after the Death of King <hi>James,</hi> which happen'd <hi>March</hi> 27. 1625. in the Fifty eighth Year of his Age, and of his Reign of <hi>England</hi> the Twenty ſecond, and of <hi>Scotland</hi> the Fifty ſixth.

To his Father (his elder Brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead) ſucceeded <hi>Charles,</hi> the Firſt of that Name, about the Age of Twenty five Years, and was proclaim'd King the ſame Day his Father died: The Solemnity of whoſe Funerals being over, the firſt thing he did was to haſten the coming over of the Queen, to whom he was married by Proxy at <hi>Paris, May</hi> 1. and conſummated at <hi>Canterbury, June</hi> 13. following. Of this Prince it may be truly ſaid, <hi>He was a Man of Sorrows:</hi> And yet, if there be any thing in Hiſtory to be named before him, it is not that He was leſs able, but their Times better. Therefore for the truer underſtanding of both, it is the leaſt Juſtice we can do His MEMORY, to conſider under what ill Circumſtances He came to the Crown.</p>
               <p>There had follow'd his Father, out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Two Sorts of People; the One purely for the Loaves; the Other, to double the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of that Doctrine, that had forc'd his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Her Kingdom, who kept himſelf
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62903:85"/>ſo long in Pupillage, and to which <hi>England</hi> was not ſo altogether a Stranger, but that they found the Lump leven'd to their hand. Some (like them) calling alſo themſelves the Lord's Ambaſſadours, and pretending a Right from God, to Govern every one his Pariſh, and their Aſſembly the whole Nation: Others (and thoſe different in Opinions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) that would have all Congregations free, and independent upon one another: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That held Chriſt's Perſonal Reign was at this time to begin upon Earth, and therefore would have no other King but King <hi>Jeſus:</hi> Beſides ſeveral others (from the firſt Litter) yet every of them deſending its Sect by Scripture, according to the narrow ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their own Interpretations. Theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain meeting with a Purſe-proud City, a poor Crown, and a Gentry that no leſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected a Popular Government in the State, than themſelves did in the Church; Both cry up Liberty, and inveigh againſt Tyranny (that is) whatever they were not themſelves. And ſo, what wonder of thoſe Conſequents that embroil'd the King's Reign! The ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of which too many have ſeen, and may (perhaps) be felt the next Century.</p>
               <p>However, the King having ſummon'd his Parliament to meet at <hi>Weſtminſter, June</hi> 18. aforeſaid, he told them, <hi>That at their earneſt Entreaty, in</hi> March, 1623. <hi>his Father had taken Arms for the recovery of the</hi> Palatinate, <hi>which, with the Crown, was now devolv'd upon Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: That the Supplies already given, held no

The King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to whom the King had ſent born Men and Monies for the recovery of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi> was routed by <hi>Tilly</hi> (the Emperour's General;) and without a preſent Supply, the <hi>Sound</hi> was in danger to be loſt, and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Eaſt-land Trade and Staple at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> almoſt given up for gone. And now what wonder if the King's extraordinary Wants, put him upon extraordinary Courſes?

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62903:87"/>However, that a laſt Extremity might not run him beyond his Natural Inclination, he calls a Parliament, which open'd <hi>March</hi> 17. 1627. where he ſo pathetically laid before them the cauſe of their meeting; which was, The Common Danger; a Supply proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to it; The Exigence of Time; the juſt Deſence of Friends and Allies: And, laſtly, clos'd all with his Hopes of their following that Advice, of <hi>maintaining the Unity of the Spirit, in the Band of Peace;</hi> that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons unanimouſly voted him Five Subſidies. On which, the King (by his Secretary) let them know, He would deny them nothing of their Liberties, which any of his Predeceſſors had granted.</p>
               <p>But while the Bill for theſe Subſidies was preparing, the old Leven fermented anew: Loans, Privy Seals, Billeting of Soldiers even in caſes of Neceſſity, and Martial Law for keeping them in order, was queſtion'd, as contrary to <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> which terminated in this, That the King gave his Royal Aſſent to that ſo-much-talk'd of <hi>Petition of Right</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet he granted no New Liberties, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Old) with this Declaration concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true Intent thereof, That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of both Houſes in the hammering of the Petition, was no ways to entrench upon his Prerogative, ſaying, <hi>They had neither Intention nor Power to hurt it.</hi> Of which Intent and Meaning of his, in granting the ſaid Petition, he commanded all to take notice; <hi>Eſpecially</hi> (ſaid the King) <hi>you my Lords the Judges; for

               <p>The Parliament thus met, the King declar'd his earneſt Deſires for the Welfare of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; deſired them (as he promis'd he would) to lay by all Prejudice, and he would freely put himſelf upon the Love of his Subjects: Will'd them to conſider of the beſt way for the Safety and Security of <hi>England:</hi> Firſt, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out thoſe Rebels who had invaded it; and next, for ſatisfaction of Juſt Grievances.

               <p>And truly, great might have been the Hopes concerning this Parliament, had they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a Note too high, to make any Confort: For firſt, an Impeachment was ſent up from the Commons againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> (who had been the late General againſt the <hi>Scots</hi>) <hi>Novemb.</hi> 12.

               <p>The Parliament now in poſſeſſion of the King, came to be divided into two Parties, <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independant;</hi> and the Army, which was every of them a Sect by it ſelf, thinking they had as much Right to Him as the others, ſeize Him, and bring Him to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton Court,</hi> about the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1647. from whence (without bettering His Condition) He eſcapes into the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Parliament, deſires a Perſonal Treaty at <hi>London:</hi> They, on the other hand, vote Him 5000 <hi>l.</hi> for His preſent Accommodation, and ſend Him Four Preliminary Bills to ſign; but thoſe ſo Unreaſonable, that the King refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, they (amongſt other things) vote no more Addreſſes ſhould be made to Him; and the Army declares to ſtand by them in thoſe Votes, and what ſhall be further neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the proſecution thereof.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62903:95"/>Againſt theſe Proceedings the Lords proteſt; and the Army ſet a Guard upon their Houſe to prevent their aſſembling: And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons wholly took it away, and their Privilege of Peerage with it, unleſs (being duly Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) they ſhall be elected to ſit in Parliament: And thereupon enacted themſelves <hi>The Supreme Authority of the Nation; A Commonwealth, and Free State, without any King, or Houſe of Lords:</hi> And committed the Executive Part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to <hi>A Council of State</hi> erected by them: of whom, Forty were principal Officers in the Army.

               <p>During this time, the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> (that they might at leaſt ſeem not wanting to their Duty) recognize the King's undoubted Right of Succeſſion to the Crowns of theſe Kingdoms: But with this Clauſe in it, <hi>That he be not admitted to the Exerciſe of it, 'till he had given Satisfaction to the Kingdom, touching the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Religion, and the Unity betwixt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, according to the National Covenant, and the Solemn League and Covenant.

               <p>While things went thus in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> had ſpun out a lingering Treaty with the King at <hi>Breda;</hi> during which, the <hi>Kirk</hi>-Party having ſurpriz'd <hi>Mentroſa,</hi> defeated

               <p>And now the Men at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (better known by the Name of <hi>The Rump</hi>) think it high time to look about them, and form an Army to be ſent thither; <hi>Fairfax</hi> ſhould have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, but (whether it were that the <hi>Covenant</hi> had bewitch'd him, or <hi>Cromwel</hi> out-witted him) he declin'd the Charge; and <hi>Cromwel</hi> is made <hi>Generaliſſimo;</hi> and with 16000 effective Men, enters <hi>Scotland,</hi> and has a Fleet on the Coaſts to attend his motions.

               <p>And yet ere matters came to this heighth, there fell an occaſion of Quarrel between the <hi>Dutch</hi> and them: <hi>Doriſlaus</hi> (who drew the Charge againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I.) had been ſent by them Ambaſſadour to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a dozen Cavaliers, headed by one <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> enter'd his Chamber as he was at Supper, with ſome of the States, kill'd him, and got away: As not long after ran the ſame fate <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham,</hi> their Envoy at <hi>Madrid.</hi> However, this Infant-State thought it not fit to make a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62903:98"/>Quarrel, 'till they could go by themſelves, but ſent other Ambaſſadours (<hi>St. Johns</hi> and <hi>Strickland</hi>) to offer a League with the <hi>United Provinces;</hi> which was entertain'd with ſo little forwardneſs, that within a Month after the Battel of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> they paſſed an Act againſt the importing of Merchandize, in other than <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bottoms; diſturb'd their Fiſhing on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt, ſearch'd their Ships, as carrying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to <hi>France,</hi> and made ſome of them Prize. And now the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſend their Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours to deſire that Friendſhip they before ſlighted; and the Rump, on the other hand, ſo ſtood on Terms never likely to be granted, that it came to Blows; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> wiſely made the Flag the ſtate of the Quarrel: Whereupon enſued ſeveral Naval Engagements.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe was <hi>May</hi> 17. 1652. where with 23 Ships againſt 42 of the <hi>Dutch</hi> (of which one was taken, another ſunk, and no one of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo much as diſabled) <hi>Blake</hi> firſt aſſerted the Dominion, and carried it for that time; and the States excus'd it, as a raſh Action done by <hi>Trump,</hi> without their Privity or Conſent: But the Men at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> requiring Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their Charge and Damages, before they would hear further,</p>
               <p>It came to a ſecond, between Sir <hi>George Askew</hi> and <hi>De Ruyter, Aug.</hi> 16. and may be call'd a Drawn-Battel, though the <hi>Dutch</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>number'd him by Ten Ships.</p>
               <p>During this time, <hi>Blake</hi> had ſpoil'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd their Herring-Fiſhing, and taken Twelve Men of War that guarded them: On which follow'd a third Engagement, <hi>Octob.</hi> 28. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62903:98"/>
                  <hi>Blake, Monck,</hi> and <hi>Deane</hi> joint Admirals for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Witt Wittens</hi> and <hi>De Ruyter</hi> for the <hi>Dutch;</hi> in which, the Reer-Admiral of the <hi>Dutch</hi> was boarded and taken, Two others ſunk, and One blown up; beſides Five of their <hi>Weſt India</hi> Ships, and Six <hi>Streights</hi>-Men, which <hi>Blake</hi> had taken in his coming up to it.</p>
               <p>The fourth was <hi>Novemb.</hi> 29. with 80 <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, againſt 40 <hi>Engliſh,</hi> then riding in the <hi>Downs,</hi> not expecting an Engagement; in which, <hi>Blake</hi> loſt the <hi>Garland</hi> taken, the <hi>Bonad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture</hi> burnt, and three others ſunk, and by the favour of the Night got off with the reſt: On which, <hi>Trump</hi> ſtuck a Broom in his Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top.</p>
               <p>The fifth was, <hi>Feb.</hi> 8. off of <hi>Portland,</hi> which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted three Days, and in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt one Ship <hi>(The Sampſon)</hi> and <hi>Blake</hi> receiv'd a deſperate Wound on his Hip, the Lameneſs of which he never recover'd; but took Eleven of their Ships of War, beſides Thirty Merchant-Men. On which, the <hi>Rump</hi> laid a Tax of 120000 <hi>l.</hi> a Month for the maintaining the War.</p>
               <p>The ſixth was <hi>June</hi> 2. 1653. at what time <hi>Trump</hi> coming upon our Coaſts with 104 Ships of War, 12 Galleots, and 9 Fire-ſhips, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by <hi>Monck</hi> and <hi>Deane,</hi> with 100 of all ſorts. The Fight was deſperate, and laſted two Days; during which, without any one Ship loſt or diſabled, and ſaving his Colleagne <hi>Deane</hi> (who was taken off by the Waſte by a Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot) but one Captain kill'd, <hi>Monck</hi> ſunk ſix of their beſt Ships, ſaw two others blown up, and took eleven (of which three were Flag-ſhips)
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62903:99"/>when at laſt <hi>Blake</hi> coming in with 18 freſh Ships, the <hi>Dutch</hi> got off upon their Flatts.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh and laſt Engagement was <hi>July</hi> 29. when <hi>Trump</hi> coming up with 95 Ships, was met by <hi>Monck</hi> (who by reaſon of <hi>Blake</hi>'s Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, now commanded ſingly) with 106 Ships, and fought it 'till Night parted them: But by the next Morning, <hi>Trump</hi> being re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd with 25 Ships by <hi>Wittens,</hi> and <hi>Monck</hi> having given Orders through his Fleet, neither to give nor take Quarter 'till the point were decided, it came to a more bloody Trial, in which (beſides their Admiral <hi>Van Trump</hi> ſlain) they loſt Vice-Admiral <hi>Evertſon,</hi> and Thirty two others ſunk; himſelf, and four Captains, and twelve hundred common Men taken up after the Fight, and made what ſail they could for the <hi>Texel:</hi> Nor did <hi>Monck</hi> think it fit to purſue them, as having bought the Victory with the loſs of eight Captains, and about five hundred common Men ſlain; five other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains, and ſeven thouſand private Men woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and one Ship <hi>(The Oak)</hi> ſunk.</p>
               <p>While matters were thus at Sea, the Army, as well as the Nation, were become ſo ſick of our New Commonwealth on Shoar, that they urge them to diſſolve themſelves; which they not daring to refuſe, nor yet willing to yield, determine it to <hi>Nov.</hi> 5. 1654. but trifled ſo much time about Qualifications for their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> (not meaning to ſtay ſo long, and the Army declaring againſt them, as a Party of <hi>Carnal Men,</hi> and not to be truſted with the Choice of their Repreſentatives) turn'd them out of the Houſe, and ſet a Guard upon it, <hi>April</hi> 23. 1653.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:62903:99"/>
               <p>This done, <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Officers conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>A Council of State,</hi> made up of themſelves and their Confederates of the late Houſe, and place the Supreme Authority in them, 'till a Repreſentative could be choſen; which not long after was patch'd together of an hundred forty two known Perſons (as the Cant was) Men fearing God, and of approv'd Integrity; but ſo ridiculous as to Man, that it was thought <hi>Cromwel</hi> got them together to no other end, than to bring Parliaments into contempt.</p>
               <p>However, they met <hi>July</hi> 4. and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd themſelves a Parliament, the <hi>Council of State</hi> reſign their Supremacy to them; and they appoint a <hi>New Council of State,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Officers, with Power to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act all Publick Affairs, treat with Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in that five Months time that they ſate, they had ſo unhing'd every thing, and done nothing, but to the worſe, that even their Maſters who brought them together, were aſham'd of them; and moſt of themſelves ſo ſenſible of it, that their Speaker <hi>Rous,</hi> with the Mace before him, and a major part of them following him, came to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd to <hi>Cromwel</hi> the Inſtrument he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd to them at their firſt ſitting; and in four Days after, the Officers of the Army having form'd a New Inſtrument of Government, they entreat him to accept it, under the Name of <hi>Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland; which at firſt he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly refus'd, 'till at laſt perſuaded into what he had ſo long deſign'd, he ſubmits to the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Time and Affairs, and was the ſame
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62903:100"/>Afternoon, <hi>viz. Decemb.</hi> 16. 1653. accordingly inaugurated in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> by this time had made a truer Eſtimate of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Force, than they did when they began the War; and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand tamper'd with <hi>Cromwel</hi> for a Peace, and finding they might have eaſier Terms from him than the <hi>Rump</hi> would even hear of, they ſent over Ambaſſadours to him: Nor was he ſo well ſetled as to refuſe a fair Proffer, and Money to boot; whereupon a Peace was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and proclaim'd <hi>April</hi> 5. 1654. in which the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was included: And near the ſame time he made another, with Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> of <hi>Sweden. Spain</hi> alſo, <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſeek his Friendſhip; but <hi>Spain</hi> could not obtain it: And ſo this firſt jobb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, he return'd <hi>Monck</hi> back into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (though with all his Art he could never get him back again) and ſent his ſecond Son <hi>Henry,</hi> Lord Deputy into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and call'd a Parliament, which met <hi>Septemb.</hi> 3. 1654.</p>
               <p>Nor had they ſearce taken their Seats, ere they fell to diſputing the Power by which they were call'd; whereupon a Recognition of the Government, as it was then ſetled in a ſingle Perſon, was ſent them to ſubſcribe, with an Inhibition to any one of their entring the Houſe 'till he had done it: In which, though moſt of them complied, the whole was diſſolv'd, within the firſt five Months; which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſaid New Inſtrument.</p>
               <p>In 1655. he made an attempt upon <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola,</hi> but miſcarried in it, and took <hi>Jamaica</hi> with little or no oppoſition: And to cover, at
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62903:100"/>leaſt ſecure, againſt the Slurr at home, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimated all the Royaliſts, <hi>i. e.</hi> took a Tenth part of their Eſtates, and ſet up Eleven Major-Generals to Tax it, and keep them in awe.</p>
               <p>The Year following he call'd another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which met <hi>Septemb.</hi> 3. and they (perhaps) gueſſing what he would be at, preſent him an Humble Petition and Advice, to take the Title of KING; which he refus'd twice; but being preſs'd to a more poſitive Anſwer, he had, the very Morning that he made the Third Denial, reſolv'd to accept it: But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was that made him change his <hi>Mind,</hi> does not appear; though, if his Secretary <hi>Thurloe</hi> may be believ'd, it was not that he fear'd the General Officers, for there were New Commiſſions actually drawn for others, who had accepted their Commands: Where upon the Word <hi>King,</hi> in the ſaid Petition and Advice, was expung'd, and he in a more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner inveſted with all the Regal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments (the Crown only excepted) <hi>June</hi> 26. 1657. and proclaim'd by the Name of <hi>Oliver <hi>Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of</hi>

After which, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being adjourn'd to <hi>Jan.</hi> 20. he in the mean time (in Imitation of the old Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution) created a New Houſe of Lords, by the Name of <hi>The Other Houſe:</hi> Of which the Commons taking no more notice than to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule it, and then falling to diſpute the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he thought it high time to put an end to their ſitting, and diſſolv'd them.

               <p>§. I. THere is nothing more certain, than that the <hi>Danes</hi> have had their peculiar Kings for many Ages paſt, whom Hiſtorians generally diſtinguiſh by eight Periods; See <hi>Pontanus</hi>'s <hi>Daniſh Hiſtory, lib.</hi> 7. and <hi>Beckman</hi>'s <hi>Civil Hiſtory, c.</hi> 5 Sect. 6. The Seventh of theſe Periods, is that of the <hi>Suenonidae,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh-Danes,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Sueno</hi> (or <hi>Swain-Ethrick.</hi>) whoſe Anceſtors, according to <hi>Saxo,</hi> the <hi>Grammarian,</hi> in the <hi>10th.</hi> Book of his <hi>Daniſh Hiſtory,</hi> had a Bear for their firſt Progenitors: For he ſays, That <hi>Ulſo,</hi> who was <hi>Sueno</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had one <hi>Urſus,</hi> or <hi>Biorno,</hi> for his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, begot by the monſtrous Copulation of a Wild Beaſt, with a young Virgin. About the Year 1346. <hi>Woldemar</hi> the Third, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this Family was King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who, after a Peace made with <hi>Schmeek Magnus,</hi> King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> brought the Country of <hi>Scandinavia</hi> under his Juriſdiction, in the Year 1360. after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in 1363. he obtained <hi>Gotland</hi> alſo, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another Peace then concluded with King <hi>Albert.</hi> He had alſo Wars with the <hi>Hans</hi>-Town, and dyed, 1375. leaving only a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, named <hi>Margaret,</hi> whom he gave in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to <hi>Haquin,</hi> ſecond Son of <hi>Erick,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> by whom ſhe had Iſſue <hi>Olaus,</hi> the Sixth; who, upon his Father <hi>Haquin</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62903:107"/>(which happened in 1380.) ſucceeded both to <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> as well as <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> but dyed an untimely Death ſeven Years after, <hi>viz.</hi> 1387. Whereupon the Government, by the conſent of the Nobility of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> return'd to Queen <hi>Margaret;</hi> but the <hi>Swedes</hi> elected <hi>Albertus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mecklenburgh,</hi> to be their King; with whom Queen <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> was ſoon engag'd in a War, being provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thereunto by him, wherein proving Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, and taking him Priſoner, cauſed her ſelf to be elected Queen, <hi>An.</hi> 1396. She adopted for her Succeſſor, Prince <hi>Erick,</hi> Son of <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſlaus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and Grandſon of her Siſter <hi>Ingeburg,</hi> Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, Duke of <hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> by her Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> who, at a Convention of the States, held at <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> in 1397. was elected King of the Three Northern Crowns, an Hereditary Union being then made, by which it was Enacted, that for the future, the Three Northern Kingdoms ſhould be Govern'd by one and the ſame Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As for Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> the <hi>Daniſh Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis,</hi> (for ſo ſhe is often ſtiled) ſhe departed this Life in the Year, 1412. After which King <hi>Erick,</hi> not ſo well acquainted with the Arts of Governing, as ſhe had been, ſoon drew upon himſelf the Odium of his People; inſomuch, that in the Year 1439. he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by 'em, and had his Crowns taken from him, chiefly on pretence that he had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd his Promiſes, nor kept his Coronation Oath, but rather on the contrary, oppoſed a Free Election, by naming <hi>Bogiſlaus</hi> Duke of <hi>Pomerania</hi> to ſucceed him. In his room they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62903:107"/>ſubſtituted Prince <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> his Siſter <hi>Sophia</hi>'s Son, by her Husband <hi>John</hi> Count Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> which <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher</hi> died without Iſſue, 1448. notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had Married <hi>Dorothy,</hi> Daughter of <hi>John</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> and by this means put an end to the ancient Royal Family of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. II. In this ſtate of Affairs, they Elected <hi>Adolph,</hi> Earl of <hi>Holſtein</hi> to be King, but he modeſtly declined the Crown, when offered, either out of a conſideration of the Infirmity of his great Age, or elſe doubtful what might be the ſucceſs of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Affairs: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, earneſtly recommended to their choice, <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Count <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> his Siſter's Son; who was thereupon Elected and Crowned King, by the unanimous conſent of all the Nobility, as we ſhall ſhow more at large in the following §. 'Twill here be expected, we ſhould give ſome account of the Original of this Family of <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg;</hi> but indeed, it is ſo hid in the Clouds (if we may ſo ſay) by reaſon of its great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, that little of certainty can be picked out.

                  <hi>Oldenburg;</hi> and that he was Father of <hi>John, Conrade</hi> and <hi>Rixa:</hi> That <hi>John</hi> begat <hi>Huno</hi> the Glorious, Father of <hi>Frederick,</hi> who, in the end, became a Monk, and left a Will, by which he made his Cozen <hi>Elimar</hi> his Heir, (which <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> was Son to his great Aunt <hi>Rixa,</hi> by her Husband <hi>Hoio,</hi> Lord of <hi>Friezland</hi> in <hi>Pottenburg</hi> and <hi>Memmenburg,</hi> whoſe Pedigree they alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from the above-named <hi>Witikin</hi>) That <hi>Elimar,</hi> by Virtue of this Will, poſſeſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Earldom, notwithſtanding all the oppoſition of <hi>Milo</hi> Count <hi>Alvenſleb,</hi> Grand-ſon of the above-named <hi>Conrade,</hi> and ſo became the firſt Count of <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> of his Line.

                  <p>§. XVI. IT has been already obſerved, how <hi>Otho, Henry Leo</hi>'s Grandſon, after the deceaſe of his Anceſtors, prevailed with the Emperor, <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second, to create him Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburg, An.</hi> 1235.

In 1255. <hi>Albert</hi> the Great made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Aſſeburg</hi>-Caſtle with all its Dependencies, having beaten out the Barons then in Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof; as alſo of the Caſtle of <hi>Wolfem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buttel,</hi> by the ſame Methods, having vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ancient Lords of that Place. To him
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:62903:201"/>likewiſe did the City <hi>Hamelen</hi> ſubmit, <hi>An.</hi> 1259. which, till that time had belonged to the Abby of <hi>Fuld.</hi> In 1305. there was an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Caſtle and Diſtrict of <hi>Grubenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> with all its Appurtenances; and in 1311. upon putting down the Knights Templars, it lay claim to the Town of <hi>Gittel.</hi> In 1376. the County of <hi>Danneberg</hi> was bought by <hi>Otho</hi> the Fifth, Duke of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> of <hi>Nicholas</hi> laſt Count thereof. The ſame Prince bought the Earldom of <hi>Wittenburg</hi> alſo, <hi>An.</hi> 1320. Another <hi>Otho</hi> of this Family purchaſed the Town of <hi>Wallerſleben, An.</hi> 1337. and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Bodenleich,</hi> Ten Years after. The ſame Prince poſſeſſed himſelf of the Town of <hi>Wittengen, An.</hi> 1350. and of the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Hardeyſen,</hi> in 1380.

                     <hi>Brunſwick Wolfembuttel,</hi> bought <hi>Helmſtadt</hi> of its Abbot, in the Year 1490. In 1519. the County of <hi>Daſſelen,</hi> and many other Pieces of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Hildeſheim,</hi> were annexed to this Family, by right of Conqueſt. In 1571. the Praefecture of <hi>Radolffshauſen</hi> fell to <hi>Wolfgang,</hi> Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> upon the deceaſe of <hi>Diderick,</hi> the laſt Noble Baron <hi>de Pleſſe.</hi> In 1582. the County of <hi>Hoye</hi> returned to this Family, as held in Fee; as did that of <hi>Diepholt,</hi> with all its Dependancies in 1585. In 1592. the Caſtle and Government of <hi>Gumbſe</hi> were made over to it by the Barons of that Name. In 1593. upon the death of the laſt Earl of <hi>Hohenſtein,</hi> that County fell in; as alſo what remained of the County of <hi>Lutterberg;</hi> particularly St. <hi>Andres,</hi> with the Government and Caſtle of <hi>Schartzfeldt.</hi> In 1599. there was an Acceſſion of the County of <hi>Blancken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> Duke <hi>George,</hi> of the Line of <hi>Hanouer,</hi> ſeized on the whole Biſhoprick of <hi>Hildeſheim,</hi> as well as City of that Name. Moreover, by the Treaty of <hi>Oſenburg, An.</hi> 1648. this Family obtained a Right of Alternate Succeſſion to that Biſhoprick. By the ſame Treaty the Monaſtry of <hi>Walckenried,</hi> with its Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, were yielded to it. In 1671. their moſt Serene Highneſſes, the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> totally reduced that City to their Obedience. Laſtly, by the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen</hi> with the <hi>Swedes, An.</hi> 1678. the Governments of <hi>Teding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huſen</hi> and <hi>Doweren</hi> were given up to this Houſe.</p>

               <p>§. 1.
