            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MEeting, ≈øometime ≈øince, with this Book in <hi>Latin,</hi> I thought it well worth my Money, did it but an≈øwer its Title Page; and finding my ≈øelf, upon the Peru≈øal, not much di≈øappointed, I re≈øolved to turn it into <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> for the benefit of ≈øuch as might not, perhaps, under≈øtand the <hi>Latin;</hi> and yet be no le≈øs curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than my ≈øelf to be Inform'd of the Matters contained therein: Since, by being In≈øtructed in the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, the Matches, the Increments, and the Decrements of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in <hi>Europe;</hi> together with the many Pretences that ari≈øe from thence, which is chiefly the Subject of the en≈øuing Di≈øcour≈øe, they will, (in all
<pb facs="tcp:62903:4"/>probability) be the better enabled to judge of the different Intere≈øts which have engaged almo≈øt all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> in a War, the Event where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ≈øo much concerns this Nation, and con≈øequently, is the general Topick of Di≈øcour≈øe.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall not here pretend to give an Account of the many Advantages which may be drawn from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Hi≈øtory;</hi> and how nece≈ø≈øary a Qualification 'tis for a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> ≈øince to ≈øay all One ought on that ≈øubject, would ≈øwell this <hi>Preface</hi> to a Bulk, di≈øproportionate to the Treati≈øe it ≈øelf, which pretends to no more than a Compendium.</p>
            <p>Yet, ≈øince 'tis probable the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would gladly know ≈øomewhat of the Author thereof; the be≈øt account that can be given of him is from Him≈øelf and Book. In order to which, he lets you know, in his <hi>Epi≈øtle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory,</hi> That he is a Profe≈ø≈øor in the
<pb facs="tcp:62903:4"/>Univer≈øity at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and that the Book was the fir≈øt Fruits of his Office; It having been read as Lectures, or a Compendious Introduction to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy and Hi≈øtory of the pre≈øent Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> for the benefit of the Students there, and ≈øince Printed, to be rendred more publickly u≈øeful. The Method he has taken herein is Ea≈øie and Plain; the Genealogical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations are exact; and the Hi≈øtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as full of Matter as the nature of his de≈øign would bear: Not but that having laboured in a Soyl, capable of mighty Improvements, as to the la≈øt, if this fir≈øt Impre≈ø≈øion find that kind Reception as may be expected, it may incourage the <hi>Tran≈ølator,</hi> or ≈øome <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to re≈øume the Work; and by engrafting on his Stock, bring the Growth to a greater Perfection; an E≈ø≈øay whereof you already have in the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Hou≈øe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:62903:5"/>
            <p>In the mean time, the Book, as it now ≈øtands, is of good U≈øe, and may merit a favourable Reception, as well from the mo≈øt Learned, as from the Ignorant: For altho' the former may be ≈øuppo≈øed to be already acquainted with what is contained herein, yet it will always ≈øerve them as a <hi>Summary</hi> or <hi>Common Place.</hi> And tho' the latter will not be rendered thorough-paced Hi≈øtorians hereby, yet will it give them a general In≈øight into the modern Story of <hi>Europe,</hi> together with a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio≈øity of being farther Informed.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more, I thought fit to acquaint the <hi>Reader</hi> withal, which is, That in the <hi>Latin</hi> Copy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt King <hi>James</hi> the Second's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, there is one mentioned and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Prince of Wales;</hi> but the late Licen≈øer, Mr. <hi>Bohun,</hi> having expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Him, the Tran≈ølator could not, by the Warrant of the <hi>Latin</hi> Original, pre≈øume to in≈øert Him.</p>

'TIs to be ob≈øerv'd of the Earls of <hi>Habsburg,</hi> That they were not ≈øimply ≈øuch, but Soveraign Princes al≈øo; an Argument whereof is, their having Noble men for their Ta≈øters and Cup-bearers.

Habsburg, Kyburg, Baden, Lentsburg, Thun, Reinsfelden, Ruppet≈øwiel,</hi> and <hi>Niddow;</hi> be≈øides the Landtgrave≈øhips (or Landtgraviates) of <hi>Al≈øace, Torgaw,</hi> and the Le≈ø≈øer <hi>Burgundy.</hi> See <hi>Spener</hi>'s <hi>Oper.

Afterwards <hi>Rudolph,</hi> when he came to be Emperour in 1273. held a Dyet at <hi>Ausburg</hi> in 1282, where by the unanimous Con≈øent of the Princes of the Empire, he had <hi>Au≈øtria, Stiria, Vinidorum Marchia,</hi> and <hi>Carniola,</hi> ≈øetled on his elde≈øt Son <hi>Albert,</hi> as al≈øo <hi>Schwaben</hi> on <hi>Rudolph,</hi> as a <hi>Fee Farm</hi> of the Empire then void. In 1324. <hi>Albert</hi> II. had the County of <hi>Pfirte</hi> in Dowry with his Wife. In 1330. <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Emperour, mortgag'd <hi>Bri≈øac, Schaffhu≈øe,</hi> and <hi>Newenburg</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> to the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria,</hi> for Forty Thou≈øand Crowns; and three Years after, gave it the Dutchy of <hi>Carinthia,</hi> then without a Prince, to be held in Fee of the Empire. In 1363. this Family became po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of the County of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol,</hi> by the Donation of <hi>Margaret Maulta≈øchen:</hi> And in 1366. it bought <hi>Freiburg</hi> in <hi>Brifgow</hi> for twelve thou≈øand Crowns.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62903:22"/>purcha≈øed the Earldom of <hi>Feldkirchen</hi> in <hi>Nebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govia,</hi> for ≈øix and thirty thou≈øand Florens; as al≈øo <hi>Pludentz, Sargan,</hi> and <hi>Heiligenberg;</hi> and had the Government of <hi>Schwaben</hi> mortgag'd to him by the Emperour <hi>Wence≈ølaus.</hi> In 1456 the la≈øt Count of <hi>Cillei</hi> being ≈ølain, that County was claim'd by the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria,</hi> as part of <hi>Stiria.</hi> In 1476 (or 7.) <hi>Maximilian</hi> I. by a Marriage with the Prince≈øs <hi>Mary,</hi> Daughter and ≈øole Heire≈øs of <hi>Charles the Hardy,</hi> la≈øt Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> became in her right po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of the Earldom of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> (or <hi>Franche Comt√©</hi>) and the Seventeen Provinces of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a Right to the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Three Years before this, <hi>Frederick</hi> his Father, the Emperour, had the County of <hi>Goritia,</hi> or <hi>Gortz,</hi> in <hi>Friuli,</hi> fell to him, together with the Cities of <hi>Grado, Ticect,</hi> and <hi>Zeng,</hi> on the <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Sea, upon the death of the la≈øt Count thereof, and by right of Agreement to a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Succe≈ø≈øion 'twixt him and that Prince. In 1496. <hi>Philip</hi> I. married <hi>Johanna,</hi> ≈øole Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Heire≈øs of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and by that Match, annexed all <hi>Spain,</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> the I≈ølands of <hi>Sardinia, Majorca, Minorca,</hi> and <hi>Malta,</hi> to the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria.</hi> In 1527. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> I. in right of his Wife, added the Kingdoms of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemia,</hi> with all their Dependencies, to the ≈øame Family. In <hi>Charles</hi> V.'s Reign, there was an Acce≈ø≈øion of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> as a <hi>Fief</hi> of the Empire then void. In 1580. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> II. partly in pretended right of his Wife, and partly by right of Inheritance from his Mother <hi>I≈øabella</hi> but chiefty by force of Arms,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62903:22"/>po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd him≈øelf of <hi>Portugal;</hi> as al≈øo whatever el≈øe the <hi>Portugue≈øe</hi> then held, either in the <hi>Ea≈øt-Indies,</hi> or <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second Emperour of the Name, wholly reduced the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> together with <hi>Moravia, Sile≈øia,</hi> and <hi>Lu≈øatia. Jo≈øeph</hi> I. was made King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> by right of Inheritance on the Ninth of <hi>December,</hi> 1687. whereas 'till then that Kingdom had been Elective. But more than this, the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria</hi> has, for many Ages now pa≈øt, enjoy'd the Imperial Dignity; which (indeed) can be transferred from it to no other, without apparent danger to the whole Empire. It is al≈øo in ≈øome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectance of the Dutchy of <hi>Wirtenburg</hi>'s falling to it. See <hi>Layritz Palmwald,</hi> pag. 477.</p>

And indeed the fir≈øt Lo≈øs ≈øuffer'd by it, was in the Fourteenth Century; at which time, the Counties of <hi>Habsburg, Baden,</hi> and <hi>Kiburg,</hi> were taken from it, by the pro≈øperous Succe≈øs of the Arms of the <hi>Swi≈øs.</hi> In 1415. by rea≈øon of the pro≈øcription of <hi>Frederick</hi> III.

In 1501. <hi>Schaffbu≈øe</hi> was given up to the <hi>Swi≈øs.</hi> In 1529.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62903:61"/>that all Mi≈øtru≈øt was (vi≈øibly) ≈øet a≈øide; 'till the Protector (having pump'd the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain by his Friend <hi>Catesby,</hi> and finding no good to be done on him) came into the Council, <hi>June</hi> 13. and knitting his Brows, arre≈øted him as a Traitor; for that he, with his Brother's Wife the Queen, had attempted his Life by Sorcery. And therewith giving a knock, a Guard came in, who by the Protector's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, forthwith carried him out, and ≈øtruck off his Head; and ≈øeverally ≈øecur'd the re≈øt of the Council. Whereupon, ≈øending for ≈øome of the Chief of the City, he made them a fair Tale, How him≈øelf and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> were to have been de≈øtroy'd in Council, by a Con≈øpiracy of the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain's: And returns them with an Herauld, and a Proclamation in the King's Name to ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the People. There was at that time one Sir <hi>Edmond Shaw,</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> who (upon promi≈øe of advancement) had been made to their Party; as al≈øo one Doctor <hi>John Shaw,</hi> Brother to the Mayor, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>John Penker,</hi> Provincial of the <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> Friars; both noted Preachers, but of more Fame, than either Vertue or Learning: And the≈øe are the Men mu≈øt make that Go≈øpel to the People, which <hi>Catesby</hi> had undertaken for Law to the Kingdom.

Of this Prince it may be truly ≈øaid, <hi>He was a Man of Sorrows:</hi> And yet, if there be any thing in Hi≈øtory to be named before him, it is not that He was le≈øs able, but their Times better. Therefore for the truer under≈øtanding of both, it is the lea≈øt Ju≈øtice we can do His MEMORY, to con≈øider under what ill Circum≈øtances He came to the Crown.</p>
               <p>There had follow'd his Father, out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Two Sorts of People; the One purely for the Loaves; the Other, to double the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt of that Doctrine, that had forc'd his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Her Kingdom, who kept him≈øelf
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62903:85"/>≈øo long in Pupillage, and to which <hi>England</hi> was not ≈øo altogether a Stranger, but that they found the Lump leven'd to their hand. Some (like them) calling al≈øo them≈øelves the Lord's Amba≈ø≈øadours, and pretending a Right from God, to Govern every one his Pari≈øh, and their A≈ø≈øembly the whole Nation: Others (and tho≈øe different in Opinions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves) that would have all Congregations free, and independent upon one another: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That held Chri≈øt's Per≈øonal Reign was at this time to begin upon Earth, and therefore would have no other King but King <hi>Je≈øus:</hi> Be≈øides ≈øeveral others (from the fir≈øt Litter) yet every of them de≈øending its Sect by Scripture, according to the narrow ≈øcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their own Interpretations. The≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain meeting with a Pur≈øe-proud City, a poor Crown, and a Gentry that no le≈øs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected a Popular Government in the State, than them≈øelves did in the Church; Both cry up Liberty, and inveigh again≈øt Tyranny (that is) whatever they were not them≈øelves. And ≈øo, what wonder of tho≈øe Con≈øequents that embroil'd the King's Reign! The ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of which too many have ≈øeen, and may (perhaps) be felt the next Century.</p>
               <p>However, the King having ≈øummon'd his Parliament to meet at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter, June</hi> 18. afore≈øaid, he told them, <hi>That at their earne≈øt Entreaty, in</hi> March, 1623. <hi>his Father had taken Arms for the recovery of the</hi> Palatinate, <hi>which, with the Crown, was now devolv'd upon Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf: That the Supplies already given, held no
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62903:86"/>proportion with the Charge of the Enterprize: That the Eyes of all</hi> Europe <hi>were upon him; and a Failure in this his fir≈øt Attempt, would be a Blemi≈øh to his futare Honour: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore de≈øired them (if not for His, for their Own Reputation) to deliver him fairly out of that War, wherewith them≈øelves had incumbred him, by an expeditious Supply.</hi> On which, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons gave Two Sub≈øidies, and the Clergy Three; and the Parliament (by rea≈øon of the Plague) was adjourn'd to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to be held there <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. following; where the King briefly acquaints them with his Wants, in order to the de≈øign's Expedition. They, on the other hand, petition again≈øt Popi≈øh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øants, and receive from him a ≈øatisfactory An≈øwer; but in≈øtead of a Supply, debate a Remon≈øtrance of Grievances to be fir≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈øs'd, before a Supply given. So that not agreeing who ≈øhould be fir≈øt tru≈øted, the King or <hi>Them≈øelves,</hi> the Parliament was di≈ø≈øolv'd, and another ≈øummon'd to meet at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> the next 6th. of <hi>February.</hi> The <hi>Candlemas</hi> Day before which, the King was ≈øolemnly Crown'd.</p>
               <p>But here al≈øo the King met no better ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs than he had in his fir≈øt: For the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons began, where they left at <hi>Oxford,</hi> with Religion and Grievances: And to add to it, it fell unfortunately, that the Earl of <hi>Bri≈øtal</hi> being under re≈øtraint, the King had ≈øent him no Writ of Summons to the Parliament; whereupon he petitions the Peers, That being a Peer of the Realm, he had not receiv'd a

And upon promi≈øe of future Loyalty, the King pardons them.</p>
               <p>But (alas!) the Core was not got out, and the Ulcer rather skinn'd over than heal'd; for the King had ≈øcarce come to <hi>London,</hi> ere they broke all their Articles, and apply to the King of <hi>France</hi> to favour their Proceedings, and give them his A≈ø≈øi≈øtance. On which, the King calls another Parliament, which open'd <hi>April</hi> 13. 1640. and in≈øtead of taking the King's Bu≈øine≈øs in hand, or the lea≈øt notice of this In≈øolence of the <hi>Scots,</hi> ran to that heighth again≈øt Ship-Money, Knighthoods, and the Actions of divers Mini≈øters of State, though done by the King's Warrant, that they were di≈ø≈øolv'd <hi>May</hi> 5. following.</p>
               <p>And now the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had form'd an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with ≈øome of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Nobility and Gentry, and con≈øequently a≈ø≈øur'd of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favour'd by them when it came to a Point, take Arms again; and publi≈øh a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Not to lay them down, 'till Religion was ≈øetled in both Nations; and the Cau≈øers and Abettors of their pre≈øent Troubles (the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and their Adherents, but more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

Nor had the King been ≈øo negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent all this while, but that by the help of his better-affected Subjects, he met them with an Army ≈øufficient to have reduc'd them, had it come to a Battel; or had he not been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øuaded out of it, into a Treaty at <hi>Rippon,</hi> he had probably prevented tho≈øe ill Con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that follow'd the ≈ølipping that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. However, it ended in a patch'd Agreement for the pre≈øent, and gave the King the advantage of being a≈ø≈øur'd of the Earl of <hi>Montro≈øs</hi>'s Fidelity to him, and readine≈øs to ≈øerve him. On which, the King calls a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which met at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter, Novemb.</hi> 3. the ≈øame Year: And hitherto was but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Sorrows.</p>
               <p>The Parliament thus met, the King declar'd his earne≈øt De≈øires for the Welfare of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; de≈øired them (as he promis'd he would) to lay by all Prejudice, and he would freely put him≈øelf upon the Love of his Subjects: Will'd them to con≈øider of the be≈øt way for the Safety and Security of <hi>England:</hi> Fir≈øt, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing out tho≈øe Rebels who had invaded it; and next, for ≈øatisfaction of Ju≈øt Grievances.

               <p>And truly, great might have been the Hopes concerning this Parliament, had they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a Note too high, to make any Confort: For fir≈øt, an Impeachment was ≈øent up from the Commons again≈øt the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> (who had been the late General again≈øt the <hi>Scots</hi>) <hi>Novemb.</hi> 12.

               <p>And now having gotten this firmer footing, to what they had begun before, in enlarging ≈øuch as had been fined and impri≈øoned by the Star-Chamber for Libelling; voting Ship-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney unlawful, and the Lord Keeper a Traitor; impeaching the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whom (after a Four Years impri≈øonment) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed by an Ordinance of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, at which Seven Lords only were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent; They proceed to Acts of Parliament for vacating Ship-Money; taking off the ≈øeveral

               <p>And thereupon rai≈øe an Army, and make the Earl of <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> General thereof, and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> Admiral at Sea, notwith≈øtanding the King had appointed another.

               <p>The Parliament now in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the King, came to be divided into two Parties, <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independant;</hi> and the Army, which was every of them a Sect by it ≈øelf, thinking they had as much Right to Him as the others, ≈øeize Him, and bring Him to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton Court,</hi> about the middle of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> 1647. from whence (without bettering His Condition) He e≈øcapes into the I≈øle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Parliament, de≈øires a Per≈øonal Treaty at <hi>London:</hi> They, on the other hand, vote Him 5000 <hi>l.</hi> for His pre≈øent Accommodation, and ≈øend Him Four Preliminary Bills to ≈øign; but tho≈øe ≈øo Unrea≈øonable, that the King refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing them, they (among≈øt other things) vote no more Addre≈ø≈øes ≈øhould be made to Him; and the Army declares to ≈øtand by them in tho≈øe Votes, and what ≈øhall be further nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the pro≈øecution thereof.</p>

               <p>While things went thus in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the E≈øtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> had ≈øpun out a lingering Treaty with the King at <hi>Breda;</hi> during which, the <hi>Kirk</hi>-Party having ≈øurpriz'd <hi>Mentro≈øa,</hi> defeated

               <p>And now the Men at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> (better known by the Name of <hi>The Rump</hi>) think it high time to look about them, and form an Army to be ≈øent thither; <hi>Fairfax</hi> ≈øhould have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, but (whether it were that the <hi>Covenant</hi> had bewitch'd him, or <hi>Cromwel</hi> out-witted him) he declin'd the Charge; and <hi>Cromwel</hi> is made <hi>Generali≈ø≈øimo;</hi> and with 16000 effective Men, enters <hi>Scotland,</hi> and has a Fleet on the Coa≈øts to attend his motions. Nor was it long ere he engag'd the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, and gave them (6000 Hor≈øe and Dragoons, and 15000 Foot) a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat at <hi>Mu≈øleburgh,</hi> and a total Rout at <hi>Dunbar, Septemb.</hi> 3. the ≈øame Year.

               <p>On this, <hi>Cromwel</hi> ≈øurrounds <hi>Worce≈øter,</hi> where (whether it were by Fate or Treachery) he gave the King a total Rout, the ≈øaid <hi>Septemb.</hi> 3. was a Year, with the ≈ølaughter of 2000, and 8000 taken Pri≈øoners, be≈øides 76 Cornets of Hor≈øe, and 99 Colours of Foot, with the King's Standard. However, the King (leaving Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Carlo≈ø≈øe</hi> in his Reer) got off in the dark, to a Hou≈øe of the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi>'s, about Twenty five Miles from <hi>Worce≈øter;</hi> where, by the Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the ≈øaid Colonel, and the Fidelity of the <hi>Pendrils</hi> (Men of an ordinary Condition) he was fir≈øt pre≈øerv'd in an <hi>Oak,</hi> and from one Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øe to another, at la≈øt ≈øafely landed in <hi>France,</hi> by a ≈ømall Cole-Bark, of which one <hi>Tetter≈øhal</hi> was Ma≈øter, <hi>Octob.</hi> 22. following.</p>

               <p>And now <hi>Cromwel</hi> returns triumphantly thro' <hi>London,</hi> with his Trophies, and Pri≈øoners driven before him; the former of which, he hung up in <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi>-Hall; and ≈øo dieted the latter in <hi>Tuttle</hi>-Fields, that there being ≈øcarce 500 of them left alive, he ≈øold them Slaves to the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes:</hi> But ere he came out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he had left the Chief Command of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Forces there, to General <hi>Monck,</hi> a Gentleman of an ancient Family in <hi>Devon,</hi> bred a Soldier in the <hi>Low-Country</hi> Wars, and who had honourably ≈øerv'd King <hi>Charles</hi> I. both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but being taken Pri≈øoner by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and under ≈øome ≈øtraits in the <hi>Tower, Cromwel</hi> (who could not engage him to draw his Sword for them in <hi>England</hi>) prevails yet with him to go with him into <hi>Scotland</hi> again≈øt the Covenanters: Where having left him, <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>-Ca≈øtle was in a ≈øhort time deliver'd to him, <hi>Dundee</hi> taken by ≈øtorm, and the re≈øt of the Kingdom generally ≈øubdu'd or ≈øubmitted to the New Lords at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter.</hi> On which, they enacted the Union of the two Nations, and the Abolition of Monarchy in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

               <p>During this time, <hi>Blake</hi> had ≈øpoil'd and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd their Herring-Fi≈øhing, and taken Twelve Men of War that guarded them: On which follow'd a third Engagement, <hi>Octob.</hi> 28. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

               <p>The ≈øixth was <hi>June</hi> 2. 1653. at what time <hi>Trump</hi> coming upon our Coa≈øts with 104 Ships of War, 12 Galleots, and 9 Fire-≈øhips, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by <hi>Monck</hi> and <hi>Deane,</hi> with 100 of all ≈øorts.

               <p>While matters were thus at Sea, the Army, as well as the Nation, were become ≈øo ≈øick of our New Commonwealth on Shoar, that they urge them to di≈ø≈øolve them≈øelves; which they not daring to refu≈øe, nor yet willing to yield, determine it to <hi>Nov.</hi> 5. 1654. but trifled ≈øo much time about Qualifications for their Succe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øors, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> (not meaning to ≈øtay ≈øo long, and the Army declaring again≈øt them, as a Party of <hi>Carnal Men,</hi> and not to be tru≈øted with the Choice of their Repre≈øentatives) turn'd them out of the Hou≈øe, and ≈øet a Guard upon it, <hi>April</hi> 23. 1653.</p>

IT has been already ob≈øerved, how <hi>Otho, Henry Leo</hi>'s Grand≈øon, after the decea≈øe of his Ance≈øtors, prevailed with the Emperor, <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second, to create him Duke of <hi>Brun≈øwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburg, An.</hi> 1235.

In 1255. <hi>Albert</hi> the Great made him≈øelf Ma≈øter of <hi>A≈ø≈øeburg</hi>-Ca≈øtle with all its Dependencies, having beaten out the Barons then in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof; as al≈øo of the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Wolfem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buttel,</hi> by the ≈øame Methods, having vanqui≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ancient Lords of that Place. To him

The ≈øame Prince bought the Earldom of <hi>Wittenburg</hi> al≈øo, <hi>An.</hi> 1320. Another <hi>Otho</hi> of this Family purcha≈øed the Town of <hi>Waller≈øleben, An.</hi> 1337. and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Bodenleich,</hi> Ten Years after. The ≈øame Prince po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed him≈øelf of the Town of <hi>Wittengen, An.</hi> 1350. and of the Town and Ca≈øtle of <hi>Hardey≈øen,</hi> in 1380. In 1388. <hi>Bern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard</hi> the Fir≈øt took the Chatellany or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Klotze</hi> from the Barons of <hi>Quitzou.</hi> He likewi≈øe ≈øubdued the Town and Ca≈øtle of <hi>Snackenburg</hi> on the <hi>Elbe.</hi> The ≈øame Prince, by a Treaty with the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Hilde≈øheim,</hi> was put in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Praefecture and Ca≈øtle of <hi>Burgdorff,</hi> about the Year 1433. In 1435. <hi>William</hi> the Elder, ≈øurnamed <hi>The Victorious,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed the County of <hi>Hallermund</hi> to his Family, as a Fief, void by the Death of the la≈øt Earl thereof. <hi>Otho</hi> the Twelfth, of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> had the County of <hi>Eber≈øtein,</hi> and Barony of <hi>Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> in Dowry with his Wife. <hi>William the Victorious</hi> purcha≈øed the County of <hi>Wun≈øtorp</hi> for a certain Summ of Money, <hi>An.</hi> 1646. The ≈øame Prince made him≈øelf Ma≈øter of the Ca≈øtle and Government of <hi>Hitzgar</hi> or <hi>Hitzacker, An. Dom.</hi> 1468. <hi>William</hi> the Younger, Duke of

                     <hi>Brun≈øwick Wolfembuttel,</hi> bought <hi>Helm≈øtadt</hi> of its Abbot, in the Year 1490. In 1519. the County of <hi>Da≈ø≈øelen,</hi> and many other Pieces of the Bi≈øhoprick of <hi>Hilde≈øheim,</hi> were annexed to this Family, by right of Conque≈øt. In 1571. the Praefecture of <hi>Radolffshau≈øen</hi> fell to <hi>Wolfgang,</hi> Duke of <hi>Brun≈øwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> upon the decea≈øe of <hi>Diderick,</hi> the la≈øt Noble Baron <hi>de Ple≈ø≈øe.</hi> In 1582. the County of <hi>Hoye</hi> returned to this Family, as held in Fee; as did that of <hi>Diepholt,</hi> with all its Dependancies in 1585. In 1592. the Ca≈øtle and Government of <hi>Gumb≈øe</hi> were made over to it by the Barons of that Name. In 1593. upon the death of the la≈øt Earl of <hi>Hohen≈øtein,</hi> that County fell in; as al≈øo what remained of the County of <hi>Lutterberg;</hi> particularly St. <hi>Andres,</hi> with the Government and Ca≈øtle of <hi>Schartzfeldt.</hi> In 1599. there was an Acce≈ø≈øion of the County of <hi>Blancken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> Duke <hi>George,</hi> of the Line of <hi>Hanouer,</hi> ≈øeized on the whole Bi≈øhoprick of <hi>Hilde≈øheim,</hi> as well as City of that Name. Moreover, by the Treaty of <hi>O≈øenburg, An.</hi> 1648. this Family obtained a Right of Alternate Succe≈ø≈øion to that Bi≈øhoprick. By the ≈øame Treaty the Mona≈øtry of <hi>Walckenried,</hi> with its Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, were yielded to it. In 1671. their mo≈øt Serene Highne≈ø≈øes, the Dukes of <hi>Brun≈øwick,</hi> totally reduced that City to their Obedience. La≈øtly, by the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen</hi> with the <hi>Swedes, An.</hi> 1678. the Governments of <hi>Teding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu≈øen</hi> and <hi>Doweren</hi> were given up to this Hou≈øe.</p>
